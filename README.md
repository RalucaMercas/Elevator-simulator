# FPGA Elevator Controller - Digilent Basys 3 (P + 12 Floors)

## Overview
This project implements an **elevator controller** on a **Digilent Basys 3 FPGA board**, simulating an elevator system that operates across **P (Ground) + 12 floors**. The system optimizes **order handling**, incorporates **safety mechanisms**, and features **adjustable speed settings**. Designed using **Verilog/VHDL**, the controller ensures smooth and efficient elevator operation.

## Features
- **Order Optimization**: Efficiently processes multiple floor requests, reducing waiting time.
- **P + 12 Floor Control**: Supports **13 floors in total**, including the ground floor (P).
- **Safety Mechanisms**: Emergency stop, door control, and fault detection.
- **FPGA-Based Implementation**: Uses **VHDL** on a **Basys 3 FPGA**.
- **Real-Time Simulation**: Onboard buttons, switches, and LEDs represent elevator states.
